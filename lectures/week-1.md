# Lecture 1: Introduction to Agoric and Smart Contracts in JavaScript

## Introduction

- Agoric is a decentralized platform for building smart contracts and dApps on JavaScript.
- JavaScript is a popular programming language used for web development and now for smart contracts.
- This lecture covers the basics of smart contracts, the Agoric platform, and how to develop smart contracts using JavaScript.

## Smart Contracts

- Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.
- They are stored on a blockchain and can automate complex processes, reduce the need for intermediaries, and increase transparency.
- Smart contracts can be used for various applications, including supply chain management, voting systems, and financial transactions.

## Agoric Platform

- Agoric is a platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts on a blockchain using JavaScript.
- It provides a secure environment for smart contract development with built-in security features such as object-capability-based security and offer safety.
- Agoric also provides a suite of tools and libraries for building smart contracts, including ERTP (Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol) and Zoe smart contract framework.

## Developing Smart Contracts with JavaScript

- To develop smart contracts with JavaScript, you need to use a secure subset of JS like Hardened JS, which is based on Agoric's object-capability-based security model.
- Hardened JS provides a secure environment for smart contract development and enables developers to implement security measures using a combination of built-in features and custom code.
- Use ERTP to manage token transfers and Zoe to manage smart contract offers and payments.
