# Agoric Bootcamp Notes

This repository contains my assignments and lecture notes for the Agoric bootcamp. The bootcamp, offered by Chainboard Academy, covers a variety of topics such as smart contract development using Agoric. Participants gain practical experience by working on hands-on coding exercises and projects using tools like the Agoric SDK and Zoe, a framework for writing safe smart contract in JavaScript.

## Assignments

The assignments folder contains all of the notes on assignments I completed during the bootcamp. Each assignment has its own folder, which contains the notes and code I wrote to complete the assignment.

## Lecture Notes

The lecture notes folder contains my notes from each lecture. These notes cover topics such as JavaScript for smart contract development, the Agoric platform, and the principles of distributed systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Agoric bootcamp, you will need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript and blockchain technology. Once you have these foundational skills, you can dive into the assignments and lecture notes in this repository.
